<h1> jeffrey dahmer </h1>  
 
<p> jeffrey Lionel Dahmer, also known as the Milwaukee Cannibal or the Milwaukee Monster, was an American serial killer and sex offender
who killed and dismembered seventeen males between 1978 and 1991. Dahmer was caught on July 22, 1991, after he offered three men $100
at a bar to come with him back to his apartment to pose for nude photographs. 
One of the three men, Tracy Edwards, agreed to to the offer. Dahmer was sentenced to 15 consecutive lifetimes in prison after being 
convicted of 15 murders, a sentence equivalent to 941 years. 
 <br> 
  He was held at the Columbia Correctional Facility in Wisconsin, 
serving three years and four months in prison before he was killed. Dahmer murdered and dismembered 17 people over a span of 13 years.
He was known for pedophilia, cannibalism, and necrophilia. Although he was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD), schizotypal 
personality disorder (StPD), and a psychotic disorder, Dahmer was found to be legally sane at his trial.
Some of the disorders he commonly shows are psychopathic disorder and sociopathic disorder.
<br>
In 1966, the Dahmers moved to Bath, Ohio. Dahmer's insecurities grew after the move and his shyness kept him from making many friends.
While his peers were busy listening to the latest songs, Dahmer was busy collecting road kill and stripping 
the animal carcasses and saving the bones. Other idle time was spent alone, buried deep inside his fantasies. 
His nonconfrontational attitude with his parents was considered an attribute, but in reality,
it was his apathy toward the real world that made him appear obedient.
