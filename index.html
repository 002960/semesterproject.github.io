<p> Dahmer was caught on July 22, 1991, after he offered three men $100 at a bar to come with him back to his apartment to pose for nude photographs. 
  One of the three men, Tracy Edwards, agreed to to the offer. Dahmer was sentenced to 15 consecutive lifetimes in prison after being 
  convicted of 15 murders, a sentence equivalent to 941 years. He was held at the Columbia Correctional Facility in Wisconsin, 
  serving three years and four months in prison before he was killed..</p>
